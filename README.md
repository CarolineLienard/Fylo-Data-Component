# Fylo Data Storage Component 💾
# A Project with HTML and CSS

This is my solution to the first project of the Data Storage component Frontend mentor's challenge. This project is really nice if you want to test your CSS skills.

## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
